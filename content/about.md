Hey!  I'm Sean and this is my website and blog.

I'm a computer science student in Boston with a strong interest in functional programming (particularly OCaml and Scala), web development, and concurrent programming.  You'll find me on [github][github] and [twitter][twitter].

I've becoming increasingly interested in web development, splitting my time between ruby on rails, play, nodejs, and angularjs.

Feel free to send me an email at sdwalsh [at] mirango.io and consider using my [pgp key][pgpkey].
